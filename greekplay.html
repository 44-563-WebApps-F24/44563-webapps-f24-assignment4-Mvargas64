    <h2>Electra by Sophocles</h2>

    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OR.</span></p>
<p class="dlg">A wealthy line of fair posterity! I have spoken. To thy charge! and with good heed perform it. We go forth. The Occasion calls, great taskmaster of enterprise to men.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ELECTRA</span></p>
<p class="dlg">Woe for my hapless lot!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OLD M.</span></p>
<p class="dlg">Hark! from the doors, my son, methought there came a moaning cry, as of some maid within.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OR.</span></p>
<p class="dlg">Can it be poor Electra? Shall we stay, and list again the lamentable sound?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OLD M.</span></p>
<p class="dlg">Not so. Before all else begin the attempt to execute Apolloâ€™s sovereign will, pouring libation to thy sire: this makes victory ours, and our success assured.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ELECTRA</span></p>
<p class="dlg">O purest light! And air by earth alone measured and limitable, how oft have ye heard many a piercing moan, many a blow full on my bleeding breast, when gloomy night hath slackened pace and yielded to the day!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CHORUS</span></p>
<p class="dlg">O sad Electra, child of a lost mother, why still flow unceasingly with lamentation wild for him who through her treachery beguiled?</p>
